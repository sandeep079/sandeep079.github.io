         Welcome to Liquid Logic! In this project, we have collected 
         data from various sources and have made them visually appealing 
         for students. This project mainly focuses students who are still
          in school (K12).We help students understand freshwater availability,
           importance, and scarcity. Find solutions for global, local and 
           personal levels.
